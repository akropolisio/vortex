# Vortex
Vortex is an on-chain basis trading strategy that aims to generate long-term, sustainable and rewarding yields while remaining market-neutral.

## Advantages of using Vortex

* **Market Neutrality** - Vortex allows users to generate yield without being exposed to directional price risk. Regardless of whether it’s a bull, bear or crab season, Vortex should generate sustainable yields.
* **Rewarding Yields** - Vortex’s underlying strategy has proven to be profitable across all market conditions and has historically outperformed many other market-neutral strategies and higher-risk yield farms.
* **Single Asset** - Vortex only requires users to deposit a single asset - USDC. This makes Vortex an effective alternative to lending or farming with stablecoins.
* **Low Maintenance** - Vortex is a passive strategy for our users, but actively managed by our strategists for maintenance and risk management. The returns generated by Vortex are also periodically compounded, further enhancing yield.
* **Ecosystem Benefits** - Vortex provides liquidity that is crucial for decentralized derivative exchanges that offer perpetual contracts to function.
