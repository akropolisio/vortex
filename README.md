# Vortex
Vortex is an on-chain basis trading strategy that aims to generate long-term, sustainable and rewarding yields while remaining market-neutral.

## Advantages of using Vortex

* **Market Neutrality** - Vortex allows users to generate yield without being exposed to directional price risk. Regardless of whether it’s a bull, bear or crab season, Vortex should generate sustainable yields.
* **Rewarding Yields** - Vortex’s underlying strategy has proven to be profitable across all market conditions and has historically outperformed many other market-neutral strategies and higher-risk yield farms.
* **Single Asset** - Vortex only requires users to deposit a single asset - USDC. This makes Vortex an effective alternative to lending or farming with stablecoins.
* **Low Maintenance** - Vortex is a passive strategy for our users, but actively managed by our strategists for maintenance and risk management. The returns generated by Vortex are also periodically compounded, further enhancing yield.
* **Ecosystem Benefits** - Vortex provides liquidity that is crucial for decentralized derivative exchanges that offer perpetual contracts to function.

## Development

* You will need Python 3.8 and >=Node.js 10.x
* Install the necessary dependencies (brownie 1.16.3, ganache-cli - latest)

```
cd vortex
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
npm install
```

* To run the arbitrum tests get an infura id that is compatible with arbitrum:

```
export WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR ID>
```

* To run the bsc tests get a moralis id:

```
export MORALIS_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR ID>
```

* import the necessary networks in your brownie configuration

```
brownie import network-config.yaml
```

* Next you will need to install a brownie compatible version of hardhat in order to use arbitrum properly, to do this you will need to run the arb-deploy.sh bash script in this directory.

* To run the arbitrum tests, "-s" will provide print outputs which this test suite uses to visualise yield:

```
brownie test -s
```

To run the bsc tests

```
brownie test -s --network=bsc-main-fork
```

* Optional: if you run into bugs surrounding openzepellin imports you may have to run:

```
npm run clone-packages
```
